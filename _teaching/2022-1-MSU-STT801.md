Design of experiments (DOE) is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. In this course, students will learn various experimental designs and their applications. Students will also learn to analyze data and determine the relationship between potential factors and the output of that process from planned experiments, using the statistical software ([R](https://www.r-project.org/)).
This course covers the following topics:
* experimental designs: fractional factorial experiments, Latin squares, orthogonal arrays, robust parameter designs, and other designs
* data analysis for experimental data: linear regression model, analysis of variance and covariance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), random effect model, response surface methodology, and others
* statistical software: [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* model interpretation
* presentation and data visualization
