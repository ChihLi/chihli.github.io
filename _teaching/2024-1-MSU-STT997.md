Explore the fundamental concepts of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in this special-topic course. Uncertainty is inherent in various fields, from engineering to finance, and understanding its impact is crucial for informed decision-making. Through a combination of theoretical insights and practical applications, this course will cover key UQ principles, modern statistical methods, and computational tools.
This course covers the following topics:
* Gaussian process (GP) regression
* Space-filling designs
* Model-based designs
* Sensitivity analysis
* Computer model calibration
* Bayesian optimization
* Multi-fidelity simulations
* Implementation in R for UQ applications
