This course provides a comprehensive introduction to key concepts in probability and statistics, with a balanced emphasis on both theoretical principles and practical applications. The course material will be drawn from Chapters 5-9 and Chapters 11-14 of the textbook, and lecture notes on
time series. Specifically, the curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including:
* Limit theorems
* Hypothesis testing
* Survey sampling
* Parameter estimation
* Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
* Categorical data analysis
* Time series (ARMA model, data analysis, forecasting)

Throughout the course, we will use statistical software to deepen our understanding of these key concepts and to perform complex calculations efficiently. The software ([R](https://www.r-project.org/)) will be particularly central in applying these concepts to real-world data analysis.
