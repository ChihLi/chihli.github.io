I'm interested in developing new statistcal emulator and experimental designs for multi-fidelity computer experiments. The hope is to 

* maximize predictive power of the multi-fidelity emulator via a careful design of experiments, and 
* ensure this model achieves a desired error tolerance with confidence. 

A preliminary result can be found in [Sung, Ji, Tang, and Mak (2023+)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00268).
