I'm interested in developing new models and experimental designs for multi-fidelity computer experiments. The hope is to (i) maximize predictive power of the multi-fidelity emulator via a careful design of experiments, and (ii) ensure this model achieves a desired error tolerance with confidence. A preliminary result can be found in
