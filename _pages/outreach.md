* [12th Annual MSU Science Festival](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/news/stt-msu-science-festival.aspx): Our lab hosted an engaging event as part of the MSU Science Festival, which is a free annual celebration of science, fueled by some of the basic elements essential to scientific inquiry: curiosity, wonder, and discovery. Our [booth](https://sciencefestival.msu.edu/Event/View/129) provided a fun and hands-on learning experience, helping learners of all ages understand the concept of normal distribution through fun and interactive games.
