Chih-Li Sung (pronounced CHI LEE SUNG) is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). His research interests include **computer experiment, uncertainty quantification, machine learning, big data, and applications of statistics in engineering**. He was awarded Statistics in Physical Engineering Sciences (SPES) Award from ASA in 2019. He is currently an associate editor for [Technometrics](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/utch20/current) and [Computational Statistics & Data Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computational-statistics-and-data-analysis) (CSDA). His research is supported by [NSF DMS 2113407](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2113407&HistoricalAwards=false).

Chih-Li Sung received a Ph.D. at the Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech in 2018. He was jointly advised by Profs. [C. F. Jeff Wu](https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~jeffwu/) and [Benjamin Haaland](https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail/u6012617). He also received a B.S in applied mathematics and an M.S. in statistics from National Tsing Hua University in 2008 and 2010, respectively.
